//This line of JavaScript code defines a new class named ApiError that extends the built-in Error class.
//xtending the Error class means that ApiError inherits all the properties and methods of Error, allowing you to create custom error objects that
// can be used in a similar way to standard errors but with additional functionality or information specific to your application's needs. 
//This is useful for error handling, especially when you want to distinguish between different types of errors in your code.
